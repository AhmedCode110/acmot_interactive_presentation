# AC-MOT — Interactive Master's Presentation

**AC-MOT: Adaptive Control for Real-Time Multi-Object Tracking**
Ahmed Gouda Ismail · Military Technical College · Computers Engineering and Artificial Intelligence Department · Cairo, Egypt

A self-contained HTML/CSS/JavaScript presentation (82 slides, light theme, 16:9). It follows the
same section order as the seminar deck `b9_claude.key`, extended with the frozen V1/V2/UAVDT
results and the ongoing U2MOT cross-pipeline study. No internet connection or libraries are needed.

## How to open

Double-click **`index.html`** — it opens in any modern browser (Chrome, Edge, Safari, Firefox).

Or from a terminal:

```bash
open ~/Desktop/acmot_interactive_presentation/index.html
```

Tip: Chrome or Edge give the smoothest video playback. Press **F** for full screen before presenting.

## Controls

| Key / action | What it does |
|---|---|
| `→` `Space` `PgDn` `↓` | Next step (reveals the next part of a flowchart), then next slide |
| `←` `PgUp` `↑` `Backspace` | Previous step / previous slide |
| `Home` / `End` | First / last slide |
| `F` | Full-screen presentation mode |
| `O` | Slide navigator (overview by section) — click to jump |
| `N` | Speaker notes panel for the current slide |
| `H` or `?` | Keyboard help |
| `Esc` | Close any panel |
| Hover a dotted word | Tooltip definition of the technical term |
| Click a metric chip | Pinned definition (slide 9) |
| Click an image, chart or diagram | Enlarge it (lightbox) |
| Click an outline card (slide 2) | Jump to that section |
| Swipe left / right | Next / previous on touch screens |
| URL `index.html#52` | Open directly at slide 52 |

The control bar (bottom right) fades out while presenting; move the mouse to show it.

## Where the results come from

Every results slide carries a coloured **provenance label** in its footer. Never compare numbers
that carry different labels.

| Label | Data | Source (verified) |
|---|---|---|
| Early exploratory measurement | YOLO latency table | Values recorded by the author. **Raw timing log is not archived** in the frozen evidence. |
| Development ablation | A0 → A4 | `06_Results/Recorded_20260905/acmot_full17_recorded_20260905_170655_summary.csv` (legacy v10 evaluator; HOTA* is a proxy) |
| Historical custom protocol | Baseline_Default, Full AC-MOT, TRK_MATCH_090 | repo `OFFICIAL_RESULTS` (`config/metrics.py`, demo @ `9e3cdc18`); `claudecode/VERIFICATION_REPORT.md`; `ACMOT_FROZEN_2026-09-11/00_MASTER_README` |
| Validation result | V1 Trial 24, V2 Pareto trials, V2 Trial 22 | `FROZEN_DEFENSIBLE_ACMOT_CONFIG.json`; `docs/freeze/ACMOT_FINAL_SCIENTIFIC_FREEZE_2026-09-12.md` (branch `freeze/final-after-uavdt-2026-09-12`) |
| Held-out test-dev result | Baseline, Old AC-MOT, V1, V2 + bootstrap | `FINAL_TEST_RESULTS_3WORKER.json`; freeze doc §8, §13, §14 |
| External test (UAVDT) | Baseline, V1, V2 + bootstrap | freeze doc §15–§19 |
| Published value | YOLOv8n mAP 37.3 / 3.2 M params; Optuna; TPE; U2MOT pipeline | Ultralytics model card; the cited papers |
| Reproduced U2MOT · pending | U2MOT setup | Setup as recorded by the author; **not yet in the frozen evidence; no metrics shown** |
| Planned experiment | U2MOT + AC-MOT A0–A4, official-aligned protocol | — |
| Illustration | diagrams, worked examples | — |

All AC-MOT results in this deck use the **custom class-agnostic AC-MOT TrackEval protocol**. They are
**not** official VisDrone leaderboard results.

### Values intentionally corrected or excluded

* **ByteTrack 0.5 / 0.1 / 0.6 / 30 / 0.86** — matches no archived AC-MOT tracker configuration.
  Slide 44 shows the verified profiles: default 0.25/0.10/0.25/30/0.80, tuned (SCI studies)
  0.18/0.04/0.20/45/0.86, historical final run 0.18/0.04/0.24/45/0.88.
* **V2 trials** — the study planned 50 but completed exactly **49**; no trial is invented.
* **Seminar-deck charts** `ch_gauges`, `ch_progress`, `ch_scatter`, `ch_weights` (“Trial 37”) and
  `ch_sweeps`, `ch_temporal` are **not used**: they show simulated / non-frozen values. The A0–A3
  chart PNGs were redrawn from the source CSV, whose values differ slightly from the old PNGs.
* **U2MOT metrics** — shown as *pending* until the official evaluation finishes.

## How to update metric values later

1. Open **`assets/data/results.js`** in any text editor.
2. Change the number (e.g. `u2mot.mota`) or add rows. Keep the `prov` text accurate.
3. Save and reload the browser. Charts and numbers marked `data-bind` update automatically.

When U2MOT results arrive: fill `u2mot.mota / idf1 / ids / hota`, then edit slide 70
(`id="u2setup"` area) and slide 72 in `index.html` to replace the word *pending*, and change the
footer label from `p-pend` to a result label. Do **not** add U2MOT numbers to the custom-protocol
charts — they use a different protocol.

To regenerate the cue figures (after changing an example image):

```bash
python3 ~/Desktop/acmot_interactive_presentation/tools/gen_figures.py
```

## Printing / PDF

Use the browser's *Print → Save as PDF* with background graphics enabled; every slide prints on
its own page with all reveal steps visible.
